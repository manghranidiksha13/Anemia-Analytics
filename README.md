**1. Objectives**
Clean and preprocess healthcare data using Excel

Perform exploratory data analysis with pivot tables and visualizations

Design a SQL database schema and import data

Write SQL queries to extract insights about anemia prevalence and patient characteristics

Document the complete workflow for reproducibility
